# Death By DVD
Death by DVD is a small pygame project I made in around an hour to work on my pygame knowledge and make test out compiling games to executable files.

## The game is simple:
Don't touch the DVD Logo, and don't let the blocks touch.

### The controls
- WASD for the Red Block
- Arrow keys for the Blue Block
